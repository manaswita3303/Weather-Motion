## Technologies used
+ HTML5
+ CSS3
+ Javascript (ES6+)
+ OpenWeatherMap API for weather data
+ Netlify for hosting and deployment

## How it Works
This weather app fetches current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. When a user searches fro a city, the application displays the temperature, weather description, humidity levels, and wind speed for that location.

What makes this app unique is that it dynamically changes the background video based on the current weather conditions. For example, if it's raining in the searched city, a rain video will play in the background. This creates an immersive and visually appealing experience.
